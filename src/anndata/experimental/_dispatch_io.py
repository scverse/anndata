    Read elem, calling the callback at each sub-element.

    Params
    ------
    elem
        Storage container (e.g. `h5py.Group`, `zarr.Group`). This must have anndata
        element specifications.
    callback
        Function to call at each anndata encoded element. See details below for
        signature.


    The callback has the following signature:

    * `read_func` (`Callable`): A callable which takes the encoded element and returns it's decoded value.
      This is the default decoding function, and what to call if you don't want to modify the decoding.
      It will call this callback again at the next element encoding it sees.
    * `key` (`str`): They absolute key of the element in the store. This will be an absolute key.
    * `elem` (`StorageType`): The encoded element.
    * `iospec` (`IOSpec`): The specification of the element. This is passed as a keyword argument.

    Params
    ------
    store
        Storage container to be written to.

        Key to write element to. To write to the root group, use "/".
    elem
        The element to write. Probably an AnnData.
