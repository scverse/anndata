# There are two jobs:
# 1. `check` determines if the second job (`test`) will be run (through a job dependency).
# 2. `test` runs on an AWS runner and executes the GPU tests.
jobs:
  # If the `skip-gpu-ci` label is set, this job is skipped, and consequently the `test` job too.
  # If the `run-gpu-ci` label is set or we reacted to a `push` event, this job succeeds (and `test` is run).
  # If neither is set, this job fails, `test` is skipped, and the whole workflow fails.
