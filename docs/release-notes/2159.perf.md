Add a `write_csr_csc_indices_with_min_possible_dtype` option to {attr}`anndata.settings` to enable downcasting of the `indices` of csr and csc matrices to a smaller dtype when writing. For example, if your csr matrix only has 30000 columns, then you can write out the `indices` of that matrix as `uint16` instead of `int64`. {user}`ilan-gold`
