#### Bug fixes

- {func}`dask.array.store` was producing corrupted data with zarr v3 + distributed scheduler + a lock (which we used internally): see {ref}`dask/dask#12109`. Thus dense arrays were potentially being stored with corrupted data. The solution is to remove the lock for newer versions of dask but without the lock in older versions, it is impossible to store the data. Thus versions of dask older than `2025.4.0` will not be supported for writing dense data. {user}`ilan-gold`
