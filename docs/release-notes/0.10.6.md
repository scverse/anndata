* Writing a dataframe with non-unique column names now throws an error, instead of silently overwriting {pr}`1335` {user}`ivirshup`
* Bring optimization from {pr}`1233` to indexing on the whole `AnnData` object, not just the sparse dataset itself {pr}`1365` {user}`ilan-gold`

* Fixed overflow occurring when writing dask arrays with sparse chunks by always writing dask arrays with 64 bit indptr and indices, and adding an overflow check to `.append` method of sparse on disk structures {pr}`1348` {user}`ivirshup`
* Modified `ValueError` message for invalid `.X` during construction to show more helpful list instead of ambiguous `__name__` {pr}`1395` {user}`eroell`
